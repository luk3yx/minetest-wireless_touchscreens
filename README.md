# Wireless touchscreens

A Minetest mod that adds wireless digistuff touchscreens, inspired by
[digitouch].

## Crafting

To craft a wireless touchscreen, use a regular touchscreen, a teleportation tube
(mese block if pipeworks isn't installed) and a diamond.

## Dependencies

This mod depends on `digistuff` and `digilines`.

The following optional dependencies may exist:
 - `default`: Crafting recipes.
 - `pipeworks`: Optional crafting recipe change.
 - `scriptblocks`: Not required at all, however when `scriptblocks` is loaded
    this mod will use a scriptblocks API function instead of its own to
    save memory.
